# 271101_workshop_assignment

i start the code by declare variable of cx and cy then explain each point in our hand and assign each point of hand with number, i compare cx5 and cx17 to know which side the thumb is on.when i know which side the thumb is on then compare the thumb tip which is 4 and thumb column  which is 3 to know if it fold or not,thumb is on axis x so we use cx.then we check the number of each other fingers that is not thumb which in axis y.then compare each fingers tip with their column.i use if code so that multiple finger can be up and down at once.after that we display which fingers is not fold on the screen.
